# Filter 'Add Existing' N:N Relationship Lookup Dynamics 365

As of Dynamics 365 version 9.0, it's now possible to achieve this functionality using supported code. For this reason I've completely rewritten this solution using supported lookup objects and Web API. I've maintained the orginal unsupported source code for anyone not yet on v9.0. I've also referenced the blog posts containing the code for earlier versions of CRM too. See below for links to source code and usage instructions for each.
